    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>
        Chemistry os the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. it is fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Chemical Elements
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangment of chemical elements Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for Hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements groups and periodic based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Chemical Equations
    </h3>
    <p>
        Chemical reactions are represented using <em>chemical equations</em>. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:
        <p>
        2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub> 0
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>)and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>)to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).
    </p>
    <h4> Important concepts </h4>
    <p>
        <dfn>Stoichiometry</dfn> is the calculation  of reactants and product in the chemical reactions. it involves balancing chemical equation to ensure mass charge are conserved.
    </p>
    <p>
        <sub>subcripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> reprents the changes or the number of atoms in an ion.
